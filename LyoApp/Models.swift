// DEPRECATED LEGACY AGGREGATOR (file will be renamed to avoid filename collision with Models/Models.swift)
// This file previously contained large sets of model definitions that have since
// been migrated into individual files under `Models/` (e.g. `Models/Models.swift`,
// `Models/ChatConversation.swift`, etc.). Keeping this placeholder (now empty)
// prevents stale project references from breaking the build while eliminating
// duplicate type definitions that were causing ambiguous symbol errors.
//
// If you believe a model "went missing" after this refactor, search within the
// `Models/` directory first. Re‑introducing definitions here will likely re-create
// duplicate symbol problems.
//
// Intentionally left blank.
